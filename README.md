TASK DESCRIPTIONS
1. Food ordering system
Imagine you have to design an application for a restaurant ordering system. Please follow the
requirements listed below:
 Create only command-line interface (no UI is required)
 It’s possible to order lunch or drink via command-line interface
 There are three cuisines available to choose from (Polish, Mexican, Italian)
 Lunch consists of the main course and dessert
 When ordering a drink, the customer can additionally ask for ice cubes or/and lemon
 We must have getPrice() and getName() methods for each meal and drink
 The solution you come up with should be extendable (it should be possible to add
new cuisines/dishes in the future)
Present your proposal of Java implementation for this application.
